# Title: Drug and Substance Abuse in Nigeria

## Aim: To determine the extent of Drug use across different States and regions, drug use patterns among drug users, health consequences of drug and substance use, impact of drug use on crime, and to provide data-driven and actionable recommendations to relevant stakeholders. 

Data Sources: United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and National Bureau of Statistics (NBS)

## Key Insight: 
* 14.91 million Nigerians aged 15–64 are actively abusing drugs
* Youths aged 25–34 are the largest drug user group.
* Cannabis ranks highest among the Drugs and substances abused in Nigeria.
* Male usage dominates with 73.8%, while Females represent a significant minority of 26.18%.
* The top 5 states with a high usage of drugs and substances include: Lagos, Kano, Oyo, Rivers, and Bauchi, respectively. Also, the South West region records the highest number of drug Users.
* Poly-drug use is a common phenomenon and a drug use pattern among drug users in Nigeria. Nearly all (95%) of drug users use more than one drug or substance either concurrently or sequentially.
* There is a significant increase in the number of drug-related crimes in the data available for 2022, which may suggest a corresponding increase in drug and substance use, as seen in the available 2018 drug and substance use survey.
* There is a heightened vulnerability among High-Risk Drug Users (HRDU) and People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) to infections such as HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and tuberculosis.

## Recommendations: 
Despite the efforts of agencies like the NDLEA, Nigeria still experience a significantly high prevalence of drug and substance use across all regions.

* Federal Ministry of Health, NDLEA, and other relevant Agencies should therefore consider the use of drug education both in formal institutions (schools) and on the street (prisons, motor park, etc.), such as community programs. 
* Greater investment and strategic focus should be directed toward curbing drug and substance abuse, particularly in Lagos, Kano, and Oyo States, where prevalence rates are among the highest nationally.
* FGN and NDLEA should work on creating more rehabilitation centres that can handle the level of drug and substance use prevalence in Nigeria, ensuring proper rehabilitation of all apprehended drug  users and offenders, particularly in the South-West Region.
* Focus enforcement efforts on controlling access to Cannabis, Opioids, and Pharmaceuticals, Monitor and regulate pharmaceutical sales, especially tramadol and codeine-based cough syrups.
* Partner with tech platforms to create drug abuse reporting hotlines and anonymous tips systems
* NBS and other related agencies should work on gathering a more robust dataset on drug and substance use, that measures other indicators like mental health, economic effect, family background, etc., to gain better insight into drug use, causes, and effects.
