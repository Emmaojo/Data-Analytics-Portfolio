# Title: Sales Performance and Product Analysis for E-commerce Optimization (sql & Power Bi)

This project analyses the purchases of customers for 1 year for an American e-commerce dataset. To understand customers' online buying habits

The dataset includes information about customer behaviour, product details, and transactions. The dataset is available; https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mervemenekse/ecommerce-dataset

## Project Goals: The objective is to analyse the store's sales data to gain insights into its performance. The company wants to identify the top-selling products, the highest-grossing months, and trends in different product categories and buying platforms.

The dataset was cleaned in Power Query before being imported into SQL for this analysis, mainly involving replacing blanks and null values. The method used to clean involves replacing these records with the median value where obvious, and using the fill-up function in other places where relevant.  


### Key Insight: 
* The Customer Base of the company is made up of 95.72% of Members, 3.89% are guests, and First Sign Up and New Member are insignificantly represented. This shows that the business is not attracting new members or signing up. This suggests a need for a more radical marketing drive to attract new customers

* In terms of quantity of goods sold  by product category, the  Fashion product category has  the highest quantity sold, and this is also the case for the total sales by product category. This suggests that the company should pay more attention to leveraging the high sales in this category.

* Apple Laptop is the most profitable product. With a $67.12 profit per product. 

* November is the month with the highest sales, with $877,881.
* The top 5 best-selling products in terms of quantity include Titak Watch, Formal Shoes, Sport Wear, Running Shoes, and Fossil Watch. However, in terms of Total Sales amount, we have T-shirts, Titak watch, Running shoes, Jeans, and Formal Shoes.

Since these products are in high demand, the company should use information to market in other areas where they do not yet have their reach. 

* The Best Selling Product further Analysis Shows that the top five best-selling products are from the same category (Fashion), the price per unit varies from $32-$86 price range with running shoes being the most expensive at $86, and sports wear being the cheapest at $32. 
* Fashion is the product category with the highest sales, indicating how the category contributes to the business. The company should therefore focus more on these product categories to improve the overall performance of the business. 

### Recommendations: 
* With over 95% of the customer base being Members, it suggests that the business largely serves old customers, which is indicative of the inability to attract new customers. It is therefore recommended that the company invest in effective marketing and advertising strategies, particularly electronic ads, to attract new customers. 

* With the Fashion product category being the category with the most sales, the company need to focus more on this product category, to improve their overall performance of the business. This may include using promotional advertisements to reach a broader customer base. 

* With an average revenue per transaction of $152 and a total revenue of $7,813,528, it suggests that the company is generating revenue and profit from the product discounts. This means the company can continue to use the discount strategy.

* The top five best-selling products indicate products that are in high demand; the company should use this information to do marketing in other regions where they do not yet have their reach.
