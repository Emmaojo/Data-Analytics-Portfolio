## Key Insights and Recommendations
1. Profit Distribution by Territory: Anglophone countries generated the highest profit of $57.99M, outperforming Francophone regions with $38.83M.

2. Country-Level Profit Balance: Profits are fairly even across the top five countries—Senegal ($19.69M), Nigeria ($19.60M), Benin ($19.29M), Ghana ($19.23M), and Togo ($19.01M).
_Recommendation: Maintain balanced market presence, but investigate marginal differences in profitability to identify operational or logistical efficiencies._

3. Sales Volume Distribution: Sales volumes are relatively equal across all countries, with Senegal (155,303) and Togo (151,161) slightly ahead.
_Recommendation: Continue supply stability across all markets while identifying emerging demand shifts using quarterly trend analysis._

4. Top Performing Brands by Profit: Castle Lite ($34.6M) and Budweiser ($31.6M) delivered the highest profits, while Beta Malt ($8.75M) and Trophy ($6.4M) underperformed.
_Recommendation: Focus on expanding the reach of high-margin brands through promotions and retailer incentives. Reassess marketing strategies for lower-performing brands._

5. Sales by Brand (Qty): All brands recorded comparable sales quantities, with Hero (129,060) and Castle Lite (128,174) leading.
_Recommendation: Maintain product availability for high-demand brands and explore bundling strategies to improve the movement of lagging SKUs like Beta Malt._

6. Beer Consumption Trends by Country: Senegal (129,875) and Nigeria (129,260) lead in beer consumption, with other countries slightly behind.
_Recommendation: Prioritise product availability and localised marketing in Senegal and Nigeria, especially during peak consumption months._

7. Malt Consumption Levels: Nigeria and Togo have similar malt consumption levels (50,047 and 50,360, respectively), suggesting steady demand in both markets.
_Recommendation: Position malt beverages as a health-conscious or non-alcoholic alternative to drive additional market penetration._

8. Yearly Profit Trend: Overall profit declined from $35.1M in 2017 to $27.6M in 2019, indicating a downward trajectory.
_Recommendation: Conduct a root-cause analysis of operational costs, competitive dynamics, and market saturation. Adjust pricing and distribution to reverse this trend._

9. Monthly Profit Patterns: Profits across years show inconsistent monthly trends, with noticeable drops in March, April, and September.
_Recommendation: Investigate seasonal factors or promotional lapses affecting those months and implement targeted campaigns to stabilize performance._
