# Title: SuperStore USA Business Analysis

## Key Insight 
### Sales & Profitability
Product Category that Drives the Most Revenue and Profit:
* The Technology Category drives the highest revenue ($712K) and a relatively high profit of ($75K), acting as a primary growth factor for both sales and profit.
* Office Supplies, on the other hand, yields the highest profit ($89K) despite lower revenue ($551K).
Products that Frequently Sell at a Loss: 
* Specific tech items (e.g., Polycom ViewStation, 5165, Okidata Pacemark 4410N Wide Format Dot Matrix Printer) and some furniture consistently incur losses, likely from excessive discounting, high operational costs or product defect.

### Discount Strategy
* Discount Impact on Sales & Profit: The analysis indicates that discounts stimulate higher sales volume; however, deep discounts tend to compress profit margins.
* Increased Discounts: May boost sales but risk eroding overall profitability if not carefully managed.
* Decreased Discounts: Could preserve profit margins but might reduce sales volume if customer price sensitivity is high.
* Optimal Discount Rate: The dataset suggests that moderate discount levels, typically within the lower range of the discount bracket, yield the best balance between driving sales and maintaining profit. Excessively high discounts correlate with lower profit margins, particularly for high-cost items.

### Shipping & Logistics
* Regular Air:  arguably, Regular Air offers the best balance of cost and delivery time, with an average cost of $7.64 and an average of 1.97 days for delivery.
* Express Air:  Express Air also offers a  good balance for customers who are willing to pay a little more for a faster delivery time. Express air costs an average of $9.13 and an average of 1.8 days for delivery.
* Delivery Trucks: While this shipping method offers a faster delivery time  of 1.89 days than Regular Air, it is, however, too expensive ($44.14) and may incur more cost for both customers and superstore management.

### Regional Insights
* The highest sales and profit are made in the Eastern Region; therefore, more effort should be made to introduce marketing strategies that help retain sales in this region.

## Recommendation
* Prioritise: focus more on Technology and Office Supplies by leveraging their strong margins. Invest more in these categories, with promotional strategies especially among high-yielding regions and customer segments. 
* Reevaluate Product Losses: The is a need to reevaluate the Furniture category to address cost issues and adjust pricing strategies. Further analysis is required to understand what is responsible for the loss. If the product cannot be repriced, it should be discontinued.
* Moderate Discount: Apply a modest discount to optimise sales while preserving profit margins, especially in high-margin categories.
* Dynamic Pricing and Discount Adjustments: Employ data-driven adjustments based on product category, historical discount performance, and market conditions. Monitor the discount impact on sales and profit from time to time.
* Product-Specific Discounting: For products that consistently sell at a loss under heavy discounting, reprice is recommended to a moderate discount or consider discontinuation. 
* Standardise on Regular Air:  Superstore should adopt Regular Air as the default shipping method to ensure a balance between cost-efficiency and reliable delivery speed.
* Express Delivery Service: Reserve Express Air for high-priority orders where faster delivery justifies the cost, and customers are also willing to pay more.
* Develop Local Hubs: Superstore should establish regional distribution centres to reduce Long-distance shipping. It saves both cost and time, and overall enhances customer satisfaction. 
* Negotiate with Local Carriers: Create partnerships with regional carriers to secure competitive shipping rates.
* Optimise Routing: Superstore should consider the use logistical Algorithm like Dijkstra to determine the shortest route on the road network for the delivery order. 
* Furthermore, Superstore should leverage data analytics to streamline routes and combine shipments, thereby lowering overall shipping expenses. 
* There is a need to investigate what contributes to the high cost of delivery Truck and, based on the outcome, discontinue the use or re-strategies.
* For West and Central, there is a need for superstores to invest in more marketing strategies that help the business gain more visibility in this region, and also simultaneous help to increase profit. This may include using targeted ads or region-specific marketing strategies.
* Furthermore, Superstore needs to further investigate the cause of losses and low sales in the south region.
