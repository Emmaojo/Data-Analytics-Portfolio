This project is focused on carrying out Churn analytics for Vertex Mobile Net. Churn analytics helps to analyse and understand the reasons why customers stop using a
company's services or products, commonly known as "churning." Churn analytics is a critical component of customer retention strategies.

Highlights from Data: 
*  Total Churned Customers: 1.8k
*  Total Customers: 6.69k
*  Churn Rate: 26.9%
*  Payment Method: Credit card (16.6%), Paper Check (38%), Direct credit (39.7%)
*  Vertex Mobile Net Customers Age Distribution: 

Key insight: 
* Monthly customers make up about 3.41k (51%) of the contract type, 1.8k (27%) Two Years  contract type, and 1.48k (22%) of, One Year contract type. 

* Churn Rate by contract type shows that 46.3% of Monthly customers Churn, One Year contract type has an 11.3% rate, while Two years contract type has 2.8%. 
 
* Reason and Category for Customer Churn:
This analysis shows that the major category of churn is competitors.
The top five clear, specific reasons for churn include: 
"competitors making better offer"  - Tariff Plan Churn/Service Churn
"competitors having better devices" - Service Churn 
"Attitude of support person" - Service Churn
"competitors offered higher data" - Service Churn 
"competitors offered download speed" - Service Churn

* Demographic, Churning happens among the "66+" Age group. 

* With respect to payment method, 43.7% of the customers pay using paper checks, 39.67% of the customers use Direct debit, while 16.63% of the customers use credit cards. 


* Customer service call and Churn: Higher service call frequency is associated with churn, and could predict customer churning. Churned customers consistently report more interactions with customer service, indicating possible unresolved issues or dissatisfaction. This trend across all states supports the hypothesis that frequent service problems may be a leading indicator of churn. The significant drop in CA (California) might indicate an anomaly in reporting or unusually low churn-related complaints in CA.

* Churn Rate by Customer Tenure: Churn rate is highest during the first 12 months, exceeding 60%, and declines steadily as tenure increases. After 40 months, churn stabilises at a much lower rate, indicating stronger customer loyalty over time. This suggests Customer retention improves significantly with time, making early-stage engagement critical.

* Number of Months Customer is Retained: The highest concentration of customers (1.8K) has an account length of under 10 months. Tenure decreases steadily with time, with relatively fewer customers staying beyond 30 months. Vertex Mobile Net struggles with long-term customer retention, as most customers leave within the first year.
 

Recommendations
From the insight of this analysis, it appears that the Vertex Mobile Net need to do more in the aspect of Service and Tariff Plans, as it appears to be a major type of churn experienced. 

Recommendation 1: Vertex Mobile Net needs to look into making promotional offers that encourage customers to subscribe for longer contracts, like one or two-year contracts, as the churn rate is lower in this category. These should be coupled with overall improvement in service delivery, tariff plans and more enticing offers. Also, Vertex Mobile Net should carry out a survey among their customer to help them identify the factors that make them subscribe to longer contracts and implement them in their marketing and promotional offers.  
Recommendation 2: Vertex Mobile Net should improve its service delivery and redesign tariff plans to remain competitive. Additionally, addressing customer support quality and aligning device and data offerings with market standards can reduce churn significantly.

Recommendation 3: This needs to be investigated more, as these could be associated with several other factors, like health issues, death, or financial capacity.  

Recommendation 4: Use customer service call frequency as a churn risk flag. Investigate frequent call drivers and improve first-contact resolution.

Recommendation 5: Implement targeted onboarding and retention strategies within the first year to reduce early churn.

Recommendation 6:
Implement targeted retention strategies for new customers within their first 12 months to encourage longer engagement.

Recommendation 7: Vertex Mobile Net should encourage customers to switch from paper checks to more efficient payment methods like direct debit or credit cards by offering incentives, as this could reduce payment delays and enhance customer satisfaction.
