# Title: Banking Operations Dashboard: Transaction, Savings, and Loan Analytics

This project uses Excel to analyse and present a visual overview of banking operations, highlighting transaction behaviours, savings patterns, loan distribution, and customer demographics across regions in Nigeria and account types.

## Aim: The aim is to provide actionable insights for optimising banking services, enhancing customer segmentation, and improving strategic financial planning.

## Key Insight and Recommendation 
1. Deposit vs. Loan Balance: Total bank deposit stands at ₦2.02 trillion, while the total bank loan is significantly high at ₦1.01 trillion, indicating a 50% loan-to-deposit ratio.
_Recommendation: Strengthen credit risk management frameworks and monitor loan performance to avoid excessive exposure while maintaining profitability._

2. Customer Distribution and Engagement: The customer base comprises 3,011 clients, with a balanced gender split (Male: 49%, Female: 51%). However, males dominate loan uptake at 55%.
_Recommendation: Expand financial inclusion programs targeting female customers through loan literacy campaigns and tailored credit products._

3. Savings Performance: The Total savings account balance is ₦719.38 million, relatively low compared to the total bank deposit.
_Recommendation: Introduce savings incentives, tiered interest structures, and goal-based savings plans to encourage more deposits into savings accounts._

4. Account Type Usage: Savings (34%), Current (20%), and Domiciliary (14%) accounts dominate, while Fixed Deposit and Corporate accounts are underrepresented.
_Recommendation: Promote high-yield fixed deposit options and develop bundled services to attract more corporate accounts._

5. Transaction Medium Trends: Most transactions are conducted via Bank (777), Mobile (692), and ATM (512) channels, while ACH and Cards are the least used.
_Recommendation: Enhance digital banking platforms (especially ACH and Card infrastructure) to drive more secure, efficient, and cost-effective transactions._

6. Age-Based Customer Behaviour: Customers aged 70+ lead in both the number of clients (707) and loan uptake, followed by those in the 40–49 and 20–29 age ranges.
_Recommendation: Tailor financial products for older adults (e.g., retirement and estate planning services) and introduce credit-building products for younger demographics._

7. Transaction Types: The most frequent transactions include Money Transfer (714) and Money Deposit (631), indicating strong liquidity movement.
_Recommendation: Introduce loyalty programs or lower transaction fees to retain high-activity users and encourage more frequent engagement._

8. Regional Loan Distribution: Cities like Abuja, Kano, Lagos, and Osun dominate loan issuance, while smaller states have relatively low activity.
_Recommendation: Conduct regional market assessments and expand credit services in underserved states with high economic potential._
