# Title: Altera Ghana HR Dashboard. 

## Aim: The goal of this project is to create a simple HR Analytics Dashboard that provides insight into the workforce of the organisation to enhance decision making. 

### key insight: 
* Altera has 23.5k employees
* 8.4k met the KP! translating into only 35.88% of the entire employee of organisation.
* The average score of employees in Altera is 63.3
* 535 employees have received Awards. 
* The workforce is dominated by the male gender, with 16.6k (70.65%) males and 6.89k (29.3%) females. 
* Most of the employees are full-time staff, with 15.04k (64.03%) full-time staff, and 8.45k (35.97%) part-time staff. 
* Majority, 13.53k (57.59%) of the employees were employees through the social networking site, while the remaining 9.96k (42.41%) were recruited from the company website. 
* The majority of the employees only have a Bachelor's Degree.
* There appears to be a relationship between the number of employees in a department, the number of training and also the number of awards won in these departments. 

### Recommendation: 
* With only 35.88% meeting KPIs, introduce targeted training, coaching, and performance support tools.
* As it can be seen that a good majority of recruitment happened through the social networking site channel, Altera should put more investment into social networking sites to attract more talent in future recruitment. 
* Promote gender-inclusive hiring and leadership development for women.
* Just 2.3% of employees received awards. Broaden award categories to encourage more participation and motivation.
