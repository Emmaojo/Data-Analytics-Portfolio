# Title: Hospital Patient Analytics

## Aim: To assess healthcare service distribution, patient demographics, diagnostic patterns, and doctor workload across global operations. 

This will help to identify gaps, streamline appointment management, and enhance healthcare delivery effectiveness.

## Key Insights and Recommendations
1. Patient Demographics and Gender Distribution
* Out of 300 patients, the gender split is relatively balanced: Female: 111 (37%), Male: 103 (34.33%), Other: 86 (28.67%).
* _Recommendation: Ensure gender-sensitive service delivery, including inclusive medical practices and facilities for non-binary patients._

2. Diagnosis Trends by Gender
* Skin Allergy (142), COVID-19 (137), and Asthma (132) are the top diagnoses.
* Females present slightly higher diagnosis counts across most conditions.
* _Recommendation: Deploy targeted health education programs on preventive care for the top diagnoses, with gender-specific communication strategies._

3. Patient Distribution by Country
* Patients are from 175 countries, with the Bahamas (21), Finland (18), and Korea (17) leading.
* _Recommendation: Leverage this geographic diversity to expand global partnerships. Consider multilingual support and telemedicine to improve accessibility._
  
4. Doctor Specialisation and Distribution
* Most specialists are in Cardiology (12) and Neurology (11).
* Orthopaedics is underrepresented (4 specialists).
* _Recommendation: Recruit more Orthopaedic specialists and evaluate demand-to-specialist ratios to avoid bottlenecks in patient care._
  
5. Appointment Volume and Trend
* Appointment count has declined from 99 in September to 65 in October.
* Quarterly trends show a spike (90) in January 2025 after a sharp drop (65) in October 2024.
* _Recommendation: Investigate reasons for seasonal drop-offsâ€”potentially related to holidays, staffing, or patient availability. Consider seasonal outreach campaigns or flexible appointment scheduling during low-traffic periods._

6. Doctor Workload Disparity
* Dr. William has 108 appointments, more than double the next highest (Dr. Michael, 44).
* _Recommendation: Redistribute appointments to reduce burnout risks and improve patient experience. Introduce workload-balancing policies supported by automated scheduling systems._

7. Patient Diagnoses Overview
* Top diagnoses remain relatively consistent: Skin Allergy (142), COVID-19 (137), Migraine (123), Flu (121).
* _Recommendation: Invest in early detection systems, preventive screenings, and health awareness campaigns focusing on respiratory and neurological conditions._

8. Speciality Representation and Hospital Capacity
* 6 specialities are present across 50 hospitals, with a total of 50 doctors managing 1,000 appointments.
* _Recommendation: Assess doctor-to-patient ratios per speciality and hospital to identify under-capacity areas. Develop capacity-building plans for overloaded departments._
