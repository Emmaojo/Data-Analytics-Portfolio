# Title: Integrated Workforce Performance and Sales Dashboard (Cross-Departmental Analysis)

## Project Aim: This analysis aims to assess how employee performance, departmental structure, and compensation dynamics influence overall sales outcomes and customer satisfaction.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### Performance Breakdown:
* 86.82% of employees (4.34K) are meeting expectations.
* 8.24% (0.41K) are classified as high performers.
* 4.94% (0.25K) need improvement.
* _Recommendation:
While the majority meet expectations, the proportion of high performers is relatively low. Introduce structured upskilling programs and performance incentives to convert more "Meets Expectations" employees into "High Performers._

### Sales by Performance Status:
* High performers contribute $75M (approx. 74% of total sales).
* Employees needing improvement generate $16M, while those meeting expectations yield only $10M.
* _Recommendation:
The sales contribution of high performers is disproportionately large. Consider targeted retention efforts for high performers and replicate their practices across broader teams via mentoring and coaching initiatives._

### Performance Distribution by Headcount: 
* Majority (4.3K) meet expectations; only 0.4K are high performers.

* _Recommendation:
Consider revising the performance evaluation framework to better differentiate employees and identify latent high-performing talent. Deploy predictive analytics to forecast potential high performers based on trend data._

### Employee Distribution Across Departments:
* HR (746), Sales (738), and Marketing (728) house the largest number of employees.
* IT has the lowest number (672) of employee in their department.
* _Recommendation:
Reassess departmental workloads and headcount to ensure equitable resource allocation, particularly in Sales and Marketing, where staff count is high but average salaries are below the mean._


### Average Base Salary by Department:
* IT leads with an average salary of $85K, followed by Finance at $82K and Operations at $78K.
* Customer Support has the lowest average base salary of $53K.
* _Recommendation:
Conduct salary benchmarking across departments. Ensure compensation reflects the strategic value and performance contribution of departments, particularly in customer-facing roles where morale and retention are critical._

### Count of Roles and Average Salary:
* Roles with the highest average salaries include: Accountant ($82.2K), Financial Analyst ($81.9K), and Operations Manager ($78.6K).
* Roles with high headcounts include: HR Coordinator (263), SEO Specialist (252), and Sales Manager (251).
* _Recommendation:
Align salary scales with market demand and internal performance impact. For roles with large headcounts and lower average pay (e.g., SEO Specialist), explore career progression and reskilling paths to reduce turnover risk._

### Top 10 Performers:
* All top performers are under the same manager (Bryan Burnett) and classified as High Performers.
* Monthly sales range from $245K to $249K, with base salaries between $49K and $85K.
* _Recommendation: Analyse Bryan Burnettâ€™s management practices as a case study for success. Encourage cross-departmental sharing of his leadership strategies. Additionally, assess whether performance-linked bonuses are aligned with revenue contributions._

### Customer Satisfaction (Rating = 3.00):
* The average customer satisfaction rating sits at 3.00 on an undisclosed scale (likely 5).
* _Recommendation:
Investigate the causes of this middling rating. Tie customer service KPIs to frontline staff performance and invest in soft skills training for departments with lower average salaries (e.g., Customer Support and Marketing)._
