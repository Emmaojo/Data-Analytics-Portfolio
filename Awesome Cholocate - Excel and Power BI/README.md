# Title: Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard for Awesome Chocolate

This project presents an interactive dashboard to visualise and evaluate the sales performance of Awesome Chocolate across products, regions, and sales teams.

## Aim: The aim is to provide actionable insights that support data-driven decisions to improve sales efficiency and business growth.

## Key Insight and Recommendations: 
1. Product Category Performance: Bars contribute the highest sales volume at $9M (49.33%), followed by Bites at $6M (32.71%), and Others at $3M (17.96%). This indicates a clear consumer preference for Bars.
Recommendation: Focus marketing investments and product development around Bars. Launch new flavours or limited editions to maintain consumer interest and drive repeat purchases. Bites, with considerable traction, can be promoted via combo offers or seasonal packaging to lift their share.

2. Top-Selling Countries: India ($3.3M) leads sales by geography, slightly ahead of New Zealand, the UK, and Canada ($3.1M each). Despite being high-potential markets, the USA ($3.1M) and Australia ($3.0M) slightly trail behind.
Recommendation: Strengthen supply chain and regional promotions in top-performing countries. For markets like Australia and the USA, assess local distribution gaps and consumer preferences to close the performance margin.

3. Sales Force Effectiveness: Top sales reps like Rafaella Blaksland ($814.6K) and Karlen McCaffrey ($802.5K) show high conversion and productivity. The average amount per box for top reps ranges from $16–$17.8, showing consistent pricing across high performers.
Recommendation: Identify techniques used by top performers and embed them into company-wide training. Establish internal knowledge-sharing forums or reward-based mentorship programs to replicate success across the team.

4. Sales by Chocolate Type: A long tail of products generates between $0.77M and $0.91M in revenue, with 50% Dark Bites slightly ahead. No single product dominates overwhelmingly, suggesting diverse customer preferences.
Recommendation: Use targeted analytics to identify consumer segments for each chocolate type. Consider cross-promotions and curated gift boxes to elevate slow-moving SKUs (e.g., Drinking Cocoa, Mint Chip).

5. Sales Over Time: Sales dipped mid-year and peaked again in December, suggesting seasonal spikes in chocolate consumption.
Recommendation: Plan promotions, inventory, and staffing for Q4 spikes. Introduce seasonal campaigns (e.g., festive packs) starting from October to capture holiday sales momentum.

6. Forecast Insights: The sales forecast for the next quarter shows a projected increase, supported by an upward trend in the final months of the current period.
Recommendation: Prepare to meet expected demand with proactive inventory planning. Align marketing spend to reinforce momentum, particularly in regions and categories showing rising interest.

7. Pricing and Profitability: Amount per box ranges from $16.0–$17.8, indicating consistent pricing. However, some top reps achieve higher per-box value, suggesting potential upselling or premium product focus.
Recommendation: Standardise upselling techniques and encourage bundling of premium products. Introduce loyalty incentives for customers purchasing higher-margin Stock Keeping Unit (SKUs).
