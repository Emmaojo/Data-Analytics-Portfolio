# Title: Online Retail Sales Performance Analysis

## Aim: The aim of this project is to use SQL to uncover performance patterns across customer types, product categories, periods, and countries.

This hence helps to inform strategic decisions around inventory planning, marketing, and geographic expansion.

Analysis is primarily done in SQL but complemented with Power BI for visualisation.
